# Traveler
Traveler is a simple sandbox-based game that allows players to freely explore the world around them at their own pleasure! 
Currently, the game has a main character called "Traveler" (which may change in the future), a bunch of huts, and small trees that can be cut into logs! 
As a bonus feature, the eyes are somewhat transparent, which makes the eye seem like it is moving! 
Note that the current state of the project is still in the alpha stage, which means that new feaures are added to this project frequently.
